31, 28, 31, 30, __?<br />
Question: Identify the next number in the sequence.<br />
Answer: 31<br /><br />

::Solution::<br />
31-3=28<br />
28+3=31<br />
(3-2=1)<br />
31-1=30<br />
30+1=31<br />
Use the same number to first substract and then add and then keep on substracting 2 from the number that is used to add or substract and it keeps on going.<br /><br />

::Bonus::<br />
(1-2=-1)<br />
31-(-1)=32<br />
So a bonus, the next number would be 32.
