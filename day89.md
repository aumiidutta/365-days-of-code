A farmer is returning from market, where he bought a she-goat, a wolf and cabbage.<br>
On the way home he must cross a river.<br>
His boat is little, allowing him to take only one of the three things.<br>
He canâ€™t keep the she-goat and the cabbage together (because the she-goat would eat it), nor the she-goat with the wolf (because the she-goat would be eaten).<br><br>

Question: How many minimum trips for the farmer to get everything on the other side (without any harm)? [Crossing the river counts as one trip. Answer is a integer.]<br>
Answer: 7<br><br>
