There are 100 doors, all closed.<br />
In a nearby cage are 100 monkeys.<br />
The first monkey is let out and runs along the doors opening every one.<br />
The second monkey is then let out and runs along the doors closing the 2nd, 4th, 6th,…  - all the even-numbered doors.<br />
The third monkey is let out.<br />
He attends only to the 3rd, 6th, 9th,… doors (every third door, in other words), closing any that is open and opening any that is closed, and so on.<br /><br />

Question: After all 100 monkeys have done their work in this way, what state are the doors in after the last pass?<br />
[Answer with the number of open doors. Answer is an integer.]<br />
Answer: 10
