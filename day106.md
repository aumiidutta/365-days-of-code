You have a normal six sided cube.
I give you six different colors that you can paint each side of the cube with one color to each side.<br />

Question: How many different cubes can you make?
Different means that the cubes can not be rotated so that they look the same.
This is important!
If you give me two cubes and I can rotate them so that they appear identical in color, they are the same cube.<br />

Answer: 30
